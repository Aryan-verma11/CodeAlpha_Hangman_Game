# CodeAlpha_Hangman_Game
🎮 Hangman Game (Python)

A simple yet fun command-line Hangman game built with Python.
Guess the hidden word letter by letter before you run out of attempts!

🚀 Features

✅ Random word selection from a predefined list
✅ Tracks guessed letters to avoid repeats
✅ Shows progress with guessed letters and blanks
✅ Limited attempts (like the real Hangman challenge)
✅ Friendly messages for correct & wrong guesses
✅ Complete word reveal when the game ends

🖥️ How It Works

The program randomly chooses a word from the list.

You guess one letter at a time.

If your guess is correct, the letter is revealed in the word.

If your guess is wrong, your remaining attempts decrease.

The game ends when:

You guess the whole word 🎉 (You Win!)

Or you run out of attempts ❌ (Game Over).
